# robust-ALOHA

Sparse and Low-Rank Decomposition of a Hankel Structured Matrix for Impulse Noise Removal
http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8101510/<br />
(arXiv) https://arxiv.org/abs/1510.05559

1. Before launching robust-ALOHA, make sure that GPU is properly installed in your machine, and please modify compile_gpu.m in folder 'bin'
2. Then, start main.m file for random-valued-impulsive-noise in grey image.

*note : these codes mainly ran on Matlab 2016a with GPU TITAN X (architecture : Maxell)<br />
